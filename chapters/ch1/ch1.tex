\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{chapterpage}
  \noindent
  This is the \texttt{chapterpage}\index{chapterpage} environment.
  It has to follow after every chapter, even if its contents are empty, because it sets up a few things for the remainder of the chapter.
  This environment also serves as a good place to put introductory material for the chapter, like a few paragraphs explaining what the chapter is about.

  If you put text here, it's good to put a \verb|\noindent| before the first paragraph\ldots because it's the first paragraph.

  Anything you put after \verb|\chapter| and before \texttt{chapterpage} will appear on the previous page with the big ``$CHAPTER$'' header.
  I don't recommend putting any text immediately \textit{before} the \texttt{chapterpage}; because that's what the \texttt{chapterpage} is for.
  If you do want to put something before it anyway, I recommend doing no more than an ornament or an image, and being consistent with adding one to every chapter.

  Surprise citation \cite{mid}!
  This is to test the bibliography (page~\pageref{chap:bibliography}) and further reading (page~\pageref{chap:furtherreading}).

  \noindent
  You can use \verb|\minitoc|\index{minitoc!control sequence} to typeset the sections and subsections of the present chapter in a format similar to the original table of contents:

  \vskip\baselineskip
  \minitoc

  \noindent
  The \textsf{minitoc}\index{minitoc!package} package does generate a ton of auxiliary files during compilation, so don't be surprised if you see the folder get filled up.%
  \footnote{\color{gray3}
  If you're unaware of what aux files are for: \LaTeX{} compiles the document in one shot, from start to finish, and doesn't backtrack.
  So if it runs into information that it needs to reference in an earlier part of the document\,---chapter and section numbers \& titles; figure numbers and captions; etc.---\, it will save that info in a file, so that the next time the compiler runs and needs this information, it can look in the relevant file to find it.}

The above is a \texttt{widefig},\index{widefig} one of the environments created for this document class.
It's a wrapper around the \texttt{figure} environment, so you can use \verb|\caption| inside it.
It passes ``\kern -1pt \texttt{[h]}\kern -1pt'' to the \texttt{figure} by default, but you can override that with the optional argument.

\end{marginfigure}

This document class specifies the margins in such a way that the text body allows for not much more than 75~characters per line.
This leaves a lot of empty space that can be used for other content.
Placing figures in the margin is a possible use for that space; to that end, I've included the \textsf{sidenotesplus} package to help.
To the side is the \texttt{marginfigure} environment from that package.\index{marginfigure}

The \texttt{marginfigure} environment acts like a float; it places itself at what an algorithm thinks ``makes the most sense''.
If you want to make it appear exactly where you specified, you can do this:\par
{\centering \verb|\begin{marginfigure}<0pt>|\par}
The use of ``\texttt{<offset>}'', even with a zero length, forces fixed placement of the figure.

Specifying a nonzero length for \texttt{offset} will move the figure down by that length.
(Negative lengths, therefore, move the figure up.)
I~recommend moving margin figures by integer increments (or~decrements) of~\verb|\baselineskip|,%
\footnote{I have this set to 15\,pt.
  If you're unaware, \texttt{\textbackslash{}baselineskip} is a measure of the distance from one ``baseline'' to the next.
  The baseline is that on which letters ``sit''; letters like `g' and `y' go below the baseline.}
according to how many lines you want to move the figure by.
In the case of Figure~\ref{fig:mar1}, I placed its code immediately before the ``This document class\ldots'' paragraph; but if I wanted it to start on the line containing {\setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}\fbox{this box\strut}}, I could begin the environment as~below:
\begin{center}
  \verb|\begin{marginfigure}<17\baselineskip>|
\end{center}
knowing that the box is 17 lines below where the margin figure would have been placed with \texttt{<0pt>}.
Feel free to try it yourself: add the argument and recompile this document.
